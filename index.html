          <h3>What is a Bit Tard?</h3> 
          <p>A Bit Tard is is a special kind of idiot that has done one of two things. First, they have failed to buy bitcoin when they should have known better. You are not a Bit Tard if you didn't buy bitcoin until yesterday, but if you had access to someone that truly understood bitcoin and you failed to keep asking them questions until you understood too, you are a Bit Tard.</p>
          <p>The second way you can become a Bit Tard is to lose your bitcoin because you are too lazy to learn how to properly secure it. The ultimate Bit Tard thinks that a hardware wallet, used with their daily use computer, is reasonable to secure your life savings. It is not necessary to actually lose your bitcoin to be a Bit Tard. Some Bit Tards are lucky, but they are all idiots</p>
          <h3>I Know a Bit Tard, What Should I do?</h3>
          <p>First it is very important to understand that a Bit Tard needs to become less economically powerful in the future for the benefit of humanity.</p>
          <p>Second it is possible that the person you have in mind is not truly a Bit Tard, but they are just at the beginning of understanding bitcoin or bitcoin security. If they do not understand bitcoin immediately recommend they complete the free course at 10hoursofbitcoin.com. If they do not understand why hardware wallets are generally idiocy keep reading</p>
          <h3>What Are Bitcoin Hardware Wallets Idiotic</h3>
          <p>Your first hint is that, as you will see in a moment, there are good reasons to think that hardware wallets are a terrible first principals idea. As soon as you realize this, even before you reach a conclusion, you should combine this knowledge with the knowledge that proponents of hardware wallets do not acknowledge that this is a very serious and very unresolved question. Honest people do not pretend that something is controversial among experts when it is not. Using
          hardware wallets (bitcoin specific hardware devices of any kind) for storing significant amounts of bitcoin is highly controversial among experts therefore the hardware wallet promoters are not honest. If this logic chain was too long for you to follow you can stop reading now - you are a Bit Tard and this website is not intended for you. In your case we recommend using Cold Card and following the instructions carefully.</p>
          <p>Hardware wallets can be very easy to use because people believe that they are safe even when they plug them into insecure devices like a daily driver laptop. This is false, but it does create an easy user experience that is fine for smaller amounts. This also means it is very easy to regularly spend from these devices. However for smaller amounts it is cheaper, safer and easier to use a single purpose phone using bluewallet.io than to use a hardware wallet so there is really no
          circumstance where a hardware wallet is appropriate.</p>
          <p>To learn more about why hardware wallets are always the wrong choice see Robert Spigler's comprehensive review of hardware wallets: https://robertspigler.wixsite.com/blog/in-defense-of-my-attack-on-hardware</p>
          <p>And Greg Maxwell's criticism of hardware wallets for non-technical users (He specifically does not like them for non-technical users). Greg Maxwell is almost as well know and respected as Satoshi Nakamoto among bitcoin experts. https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/jp2fp3/opinion_regarding_security/gbbzqu7/</p>
